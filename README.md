# CQL Tests Repository

This repository contains a suite of test cases for [Clinical Quality Language](http://cql.hl7.org) that allow implementations to determine the correct expected behavior of CQL language capabilities. The tests here were initially copied from the informative test cases published as part of the CQL specification.
